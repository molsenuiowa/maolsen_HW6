            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Maintaining a 3.5/4.0 major GPA at the University of Iowa has been a point of pride throughout my academic journey. Prior to my collegiate pursuits, I've adapted a strong work ethic and time management skills through various labor-intensive roles. These experiences, coupled with my roles as an entry cook at a ski resort and a caddie at a private golf course, have instilled in me invaluable lessons in effective management and professionalism.</p>

            <p>Outside of work, I was in extracurricular involvement, where I've actively participated in sports teams, including varsity football during my high school years. Currently, as a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, I have had the privilege of serving as the Vice President Member Development. This leadership role has allowed me to further develop my organizational abilities and interpersonal skills.</p>
